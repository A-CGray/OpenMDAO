# OpenMDAO Versions
> **PLEASE NOTE**: Until recently, this repository was named **OpenMDAO/blue**. 
If you had cloned that repository, please update your repository name and 
remotes to reflect these changes. You can find instructions [here][7].

The **OpenMDAO 2.x.y** code has taken the name **OpenMDAO**, and is maintained 
[here][4]. To install the latest release, run `pip install --update openmdao`.

The **OpenMDAO 1.7.4** code repository is now named **OpenMDAO1**, and has moved
[here][5]. To install it, run: `pip install "openmdao<2"` (the quotes around 
`openmdao<2` are required). 

The legacy **OpenMDAO v0.x** (versions 0.13.0 and older) of the 
**OpenMDAO-Framework** are [here][8].


# OpenMDAO 2
This is an ALPHA version of **OpenMDAO 2**.

The latest docs can be found [here][2].

Archived versions of the docs can be found [here][3].

## Important Note
While the API is MOSTLY stable, we reserve the right to change things as needed.

We will be making frequent updates to this code. If youâ€™re going to try it,
make sure you pull these updates often.


## Features of OpenMDAO 1.7.4 Not Yet in 2.x.y

Be aware that this is an Alpha.
Not all the features of 1.7.4 exist in 2.x.y yet.

# Installation Instructions
You have two means for installing OpenMDAO, from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from a clone of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO).
### Install from [PyPI][1]
This is the easist way to install **OpenMDAO**.
> `pip install openmdao`

To install the testing dependencies, run:
> `pip install openmdao[develop]`

### Install from a Cloned Repository
This allows you to install **OpenMDAO** from a local copy of the source code.
> `git clone http://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO`
>
> `pip install OpenMDAO`

#### Install the Developer Dependencies
This includes the packages necessary for running **OpenMDAO**'s tests.  
> `pip install OpenMDAO[develop]`

If you would like to make changes to **OpenMDAO** it is recommended you
install it in *editable* mode (i.e., development mode).
> `pip install -e OpenMDAO[develop]`

If you are planning to change the Developer mode will allow you to make changes
to the OpenMDAO code

#### Install the documentation making dependencies
> `pip install OpenMDAO[docs]`

# Documentation Building Instructions
> Make sure you followed the [instructions](#install-from-a-cloned-repository)
for installing **OpenMDAO** from a cloned repository, and the 
[instructions](#install-the-documentation-making-dependencies) for installing 
the documentation making dependencies

> You will need **make** to build the documentation.  If you are using Windows,
you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and install 
**make** by running: `conda install make`.

Change to the docs directory:

> `cd OpenMDAO/openmdao/docs`
>
> `make clean; make all`

This will build the docs into `openmdao/docs/_build/html`.

Then, just open  `openmdao/docs/_build/html/index.html` in a browser see the 
docs.


# Testing Instructions
1. Install OpenMDAO and its testing dependencies:

    >`pip install openmdao[develop]`

2. Run tests:

    > `testflo openmdao -n 1`

3. If everything works correctly, you should see a message that there 
were no failures.  If you see failures, you are encouraged to report
it as an [issue][6].  If so, please make sure you include your system spec,
and include the error message.

    > If tests fail, please include your system information, you can obtain that
    by running the following commands in *python* and copying the results 
    produced by the last line.
    ```python
    >>> import platform
    >>> import sys
    >>>
    >>> info = platform.uname()
    >>> (info.system, info.version), (info.machine, info.processor), sys.version
    ```
    > Which should produce a result similar to:
    ```python
    (('Windows', '10.0.17134'),
     ('AMD64', 'Intel64 Family 6 Model 94 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel'),
      '3.6.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul 26 2018, 11:48:23) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]')
    ```
