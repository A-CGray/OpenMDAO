EqualityConstraintsComp
***********************

`EqualityConstraintsComp` is a specialized component that provides a simple way to implement
equality constraints.

You can add one or more outputs to an `EqualityConstraintsComp` that compute
the difference between a pair of input values for the purposes of driving the two inputs to equality.

The following inputs and outputs are associated with each output variable.

=========== ======= ====================================================
Name        I/O     Description
=========== ======= ====================================================
{name}      output  output variable
lhs:{name}  input   left-hand side of difference equation
rhs:{name}  input   right-hand side of difference equation
mult:{name} input   left-hand side multiplier of difference equation
=========== ======= ====================================================

The right-hand side is optional and will default to zero if not connected.
The multiplier is optional and will default to 1.0 if not connected. The
left-hand side should always be defined.

The `EqualityConstraintsComp` supports vectorized outputs. Simply provide a default
value or shape when adding the difference equation that reflects the correct shape.

`EqualityConstraintsComp` accepts the following other arguments (which are all passed
to ``add_eq_output`` during initialization):

=============== ======================== ===================================================================================
Name            Type                     Description
=============== ======================== ===================================================================================
eq_units        str or None              Units associated with left-hand and right-hand side. (mult is treated as unitless).
lhs_name        str or None              Optional name associated with the left-hand side of the difference equation.
rhs_name        str or None              Optional name associated with the right-hand side of the difference equation.
rhs_val         int, float, or np.array  Default value for the right-hand side.
use_mult        bool                     Specifies whether the left-hand side multiplier is to be used.
mult_name       str or None              Optional name associated with the left-hand side multiplier variable.
mult_val        int, float, or np.array  Default value for the left-hand side multiplier.
add_constraint  bool                     Specifies whether to add an equality constraint.
kwargs          dict or named arguments  Additional arguments to be passed for the creation of the output variable.

Example: Sellar IDF
-------------------

The following example shows an Individual Design Feasible (IDF) architecture for the
:ref:`Sellar <sellar>` problem that demonstrates the use of an `EqualityConstraintsComp`.

In IDF, the direct coupling between the disciplines is removed and the coupling variables
are added to the optimizerâ€™s design variables. The algorithm calls for two new equality
constraints that enforce the coupling between the disciplines. This ensures that the
solution is a feasible coupling, though it is achieved through the optimizer instead of
using a solver.  The two new equality constraints are implemented in this example with
an `EqualityConstraintsComp`.
