    "# Computing Partial Derivatives of Components Using JAX\n",

    "write code for the analytic partial derivatives of their `Components`. To avoid that, users can use \n",
    "the optional third-party [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library, which can \n",
    "automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions.  To simplify jax usage within OpenMDAO, \n",
    "we've created two component classes, [JaxExplicitComponent](jax_explicitcomp_api.ipynb) and \n",
    "[JaxImplicitComponent](jax_implicitcomp_api.ipynb).  These components require only the definition of \n",
    "a `compute_primal` method that takes the component's inputs as arguments and returns the component's \n",
    "outputs.  For a `JaxExplicitComponent`, `compute_primal` replaces the `compute` method, and for a\n",
    "`JaxImplicitComponent` it replaces the `apply_nonlinear` method.\n",
