    "# Timing Systems under MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way to view timings for methods called on specific group and component instances in an OpenMDAO model.  Not only does it\n",
    "have lower overhead than the previously discussed instance-based profiler, but it also displays, when running your model under MPI, how that model spends its time across MPI processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to use it is via the command line using the `openmdao timing` command. For example:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "    openmdao timing <your_python_script_here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will collect the timing data and pop up a table viewer like the one shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An example of a timing viewer](timing_viewer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a row in the table for each method specified for each group or component instance in the model, on each MPI rank.  The default set of methods is `_solve_nonlinear`, `_solve_linear`, `_apply_nonlinear`, `_apply_linear`, and `_linearize`. There are columns in the table for mpi rank, number of procs, level in the system tree, whether a system is a parallel group or not, problem name, system path, method name, number of calls, total time, percent of total time, average time, min time, and max time. All columns are sortable, and are also filterable in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using filters on various columns, it's a simple process to zero in on any level of the system tree containing children of a ParallelGroup in order to see how processes and execution time is split up among those children. For example, in the table shown above, we've filtered out all but tree level 3 and all systems but `traj.phases` and below.  Finally, we've filtered out all functions but `_solve_nonlinear`. This combination of filters shows us only the direct children of `traj.phases` which happens to be a ParallelGroup.  And we can see from the table that `traj.phases.climb2` is using 3 processes, while all of the other children share a single process.  The model in this example was run using 4 processes.  Looking at the time taken by `climb2` vs the other children, it might actually be better to run this model without using a ParallelGroup for `traj.phases` at all!\n",
