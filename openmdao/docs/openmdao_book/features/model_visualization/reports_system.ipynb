    "\n",
    "By default, OpenMDAO will generate several common reports when you run your model. Here are the names of the current default reports in the reporting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. n2\n",
    "2. scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "The n2 report is generated after `Problem.final_setup`.\n",
    "The scaling report is run after `Driver._compute_totals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the reports are only run the first time the method is run on a given instance. For example, the scaling report is only run after the first call to `Driver._compute_totals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reports, will, by default be put into a folder named after the Problem name. For example, if your model\n",
    "has a single Problem and its default name, `problem1`, was not changed by the user, the reports will be placed in a directory named\n",
    "`problem1_reports`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user has control over this reporting by setting some environment variables which are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlling which reports get run\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn off all the report generation that is part of the default report generation system of OpenMDAO,\n",
    "the user should set an environment variable of `OPENMDAO_REPORTS` to any one of these four values: '0', 'false', 'off', or 'none'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can also have more fine-grained control over what reports get run by setting this environment variable to a string that lists the reports to run. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```OPENMDAO_REPORTS=n2```\n",
    "\n",
    "```OPENMDAO_REPORTS=n2,scaling```\n",
    "\n",
    "```OPENMDAO_REPORTS=None```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `OPENMDAO_REPORTS` is not set, all reports are run. The user can also explicitly turn on all reports by setting `OPENMDAO_REPORTS` to any of these four values: '1', 'true', 'on', or 'all'."
